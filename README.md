Our team plans to create a blog style site that will communicate with our database to display UTD studentsâ€™ favorite restaurants, menu items, and more. The database system will solve the issue by acting as an organized, centralized storage space for the local restaurant data students wish to share. Users will utilize a form to add information about their favorite restaurants, and this data will then be displayed on the site. Users can also search for the most popular places within the site and this data will be retrieved from our database. Our site aims to bring UTD students together with good food and good conversation.
